    Combining the profound and the playful, the Museum of Sex has become one of New York City's top-rated attractions on TripAdvisor since it opened in Manhattan in 2002.
Now the museum is coming to Miami, Florida, where a new outpost will house everything from "sexy robots" to an exhibition on the history of sexual health products.
Set to open this spring, the institution will occupy a vast 32,000-square-foot converted warehouse in Miami's Allapattah neighborhood, which is home to a growing number of art and design venues.

    The museum's permanent collection contains over 20,000 artifacts and artworks, spanning photographs, costumes and historic sex toys. Gluck said the opening of an outpost in Miami, which is already home to an erotic art museum, marked a "major milestone" for the institution.
